# parket
A python parser packet for studying and analyzing **Context Free Grammars**(CFG), including Earley, GLR(0), LALR(1) 
parsers. Also LL(1) parser based upon Parsing Expression Grammar(PEG) is being coorperated thereto.

Features:

## Object-Oriented grammar definition 

Since the traditional way of using yacc/bison tool chains needs the definition of grammar to be written as a
separate files, which can be treated as a **DSL**(Domain Specified Language) based upon C language, is too
much a over-complexed work for parsing simple CFGs in many practical cases handling text. By making use of 
high-level features of Python, writing grammars can be almost the same the syntax for defining classes with methods within
Python's syntax.

- The concepts with metaprogramming to support lexical/syntactic/semantic definition.
